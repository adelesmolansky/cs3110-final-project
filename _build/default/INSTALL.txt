TODO:
Write instructions on how to install and build your system. 
This file should include any commands your PM needs to run to install OPAM packages, etc. 

If your PM is running on a different OS than you, and if that becomes a problem, 
then use the 3110 virtual machine (available in an appendix to the textbook) as a neutral ground you can both use.
