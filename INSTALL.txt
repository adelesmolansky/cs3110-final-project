Start the Server:
  make server
Start the Client:
  make client

  Comment:  Open two terminal windows, one for the server and one for the client. 
            Run "make client" on the client terminal window and then run 
            "make server" on the server window. Type a username in the client window
            and watch the response show up on the server window to show that it has been acknowledged.
