Start the Server:
  1. Run the following commands in a terminal to get the server running
    cd src
    dune exec ./server.exe 
  2. In another terminal, run the following command to get the IP address of your computer where the server is running
    ifconffig
  3. Find en0 and locate the inet (ex: 10.49.62.59). This is the IP address that someone else can use to connect to your server

Start the Client:
  make client

  Comment:  At the moment, both the host address and the port number are hard coded into the main () function.
            After starting the server and checking these values, replace them into the client_view.ml file.
